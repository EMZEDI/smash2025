  <h5>Sustainability, Healthcare and Safety, that's a bit of an odd mix - what's the deal?</h5>
  <p>You’re not wrong. But that's kind of the point! We’re firm believers that creating spaces that cut across academic boundaries yields compelling insights.</p>

  <p>This event explores how AI in Sustainability and Healthcare are on parallel regulatory and operational trajectories and that they might benefit from a mutual exchange of ideas, governance and tooling.</p>
