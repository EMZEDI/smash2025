We invite researchers to submit 4 page extended abstracts under the research areas defined below.

### ML Safety, Privacy, Model Accountability and Alignment:
- Safety, robustness and alignment of ML systems
- ML systems and software traceability
- Applications of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs): differential privacy, federated learning, etc.
- ML performance and benchmarking methods
- Mechanisms for ML provenance tracking and watermarking
- Safety use cases for advanced AI systems

### Interdisciplinary Submissions from Law and Social Sciences:
- Acceptance of ML technologies by clinicians, patients, and administrators
- ML risk assessments and disclosures
- Ethical considerations when deploying ML systems
- Regulation of ML technology

Contributions to SMASH that are of an applied nature are also welcome, such as case studies deploying ML with sensitive data.

### Healthcare Applications:
- Applications of AI in healthcare (administration, precision medicine, patient care, diagnostics)
- Using patient data in ML research
- Healthcare ML metrics, monitoring and benchmarking

### Methods for ML Sustainability:
- ML emissions accounting metrics
- Case studies and applications of sustainability in ML
- Sustainable computing and system design
- Environmental accounting methods for ML

#### Sustainability, Healthcare and Safety, that's a bit of an odd mix - what's the deal?

You're not wrong. But that's kind of the point! We're firm believers that creating spaces that cut across academic boundaries yields compelling insights.

This event explores how AI in Sustainability and Healthcare are on parallel regulatory and operational trajectories and that they might benefit from a mutual exchange of ideas, governance and tooling.

## Key Dates
- **Jul 12, 2025:** Submission opens
- **Aug 31, 2025:** Paper submission deadline

## How to Submit
Please click on the following to access the OpenReview Submission Portal:

#### [OpenReview Submission](https://openreview.net/group?id=smashcon.org/SMASH/2025/Symposium&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)#tab-your-consoles).

All authors must complete a form to confirm their OpenReview profile is complete and any qualified author may be assigned to review.

## Submission Details
Submissions should consist of a summary, and an extended abstract of between one and four pages (including figures and references). We invite you to use a single column LaTeX or RTF template and recommend the [ICLR 2025 OpenReview Conference Submission](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-iclr-2025-conference-submission/gqzkdyycxtvt) template.

All submissions will be evaluated in terms of relevance, impact, community interest, technical quality, and clarity. There will be no rebuttal period.  Exceptional abstracts will be selected for oral presentations and all accepted submissions will be invited to contribute a poster presentation.

Submissions are single blind, so author names should appear on submitted PDFs.
