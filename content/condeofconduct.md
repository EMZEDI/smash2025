title = "Code of Conduct" 
+++

At SMASH, we believe that open exchange, critical inquiry, and respectful dialogue are the cornerstones of scientific progress in machine learning and related fields. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone—regardless of background—feels welcomed, valued, and safe.

#### Who This Applies To
This Code of Conduct applies to all participants at SMASH events: attendees, speakers, organizers, reviewers, sponsors, and volunteers. It extends to official activities, including workshops, poster sessions, and SMASH-sponsored social events, as well as communication on official channels and social media. All participants are expected to adhere to this code throughout the event. The SMASH organizing team will enforce these guidelines, and we ask for your full cooperation in upholding a respectful and inclusive space.

#### Scope of the Code
SMASH is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone. Harassment, discrimination, bullying, and retaliation are strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments or behavior related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs, or technology choices.
- Intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of sessions, unwelcome sexual attention, or any form of harassment, whether verbal, physical, or visual.
- Inappropriate physical contact, harassing photography or recording, vulgar exchanges, or belittling remarks.
- Creating or contributing to a sexualized environment through language, attire, or visuals.

This code covers all SMASH venues and affiliated spaces. While SMASH cannot control behavior in non-sponsored locations (e.g., hotels, restaurants), we expect participants to carry the spirit of this code beyond official events. Sponsors are also expected to uphold these standards and must avoid using materials or engaging in activities that could be considered offensive, demeaning, or inappropriate.

#### Consequences of Violations
If you are asked to stop inappropriate behavior, you are expected to comply immediately. The SMASH organizers reserve the right to take any necessary action in response to violations, including but not limited to:

Issuing warnings (formal or informal)

Revoking conference access without refund

Banning future participation

Reporting the incident to relevant institutions or authorities

“Just joking” is not an acceptable defense; the impact of your behavior matters more than your intent. An appeals process will be made available if disciplinary action is taken.

#### Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or if you have concerns about inclusion or safety, please reach out to the SMASH conference chairs. All reports will be handled with discretion and care.
