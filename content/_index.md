## Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and Healthcare
The Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and Healthcare (SMASH) is an interdisciplinary gathering focused on operationalizing AI today. The goal of this event is to identify challenges and propose technical, ethical and regulatory solutions to AI safety, data privacy, model interpretability and accountability. This symposium will explore these research topics through the lens of healthcare and sustainability.

Today, healthcare presents a real-world use case for AI deployments and work in sustainability and in healthcare benefit from better model safety and accountability. Each field relies on an ecosystem of providers, tools and datasets where the risks and opportunities are borne by all.

We invite researchers to submit 4 page extended abstracts under the following research areas:

Healthcare and Sustainability:
- Applications of AI in healthcare (administration, precision medicine, patient care, diagnostics)
- Using patient data in ML research
- Healthcare ML metrics, monitoring and benchmarking

Methods for ML sustainability
- ML emissions accounting metrics
- Case studies and applications of sustainability in ML

ML Safety, Privacy, Model Accountability and Alignment:
- Safety, robustness and alignment of ML systems
- ML systems and software traceability
- Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs): differential privacy, federated learning, secure multi-party computation, etc.
- ML performance and benchmarking methods
- Mechanisms for ML provenance tracking and watermarking

Interdisciplinary submissions from law and social sciences:
- ML risk assessments and disclosures
- Ethical considerations when deploying ML systems
- Regulation of ML technology

#### Organizing Team (TBD):
- Jonathan Lebensold (Mila / Akinox)
- Scott Schaffter (Google Sustainability)
- Shahrad Mohammadzadeh (Mila / McGill)
- Doina Precup (Mila / McGill / Google Deepmind)
