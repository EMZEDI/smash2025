## Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and Healthcare
SMASH is intended to bring industrial, governmental and academic institutions together to collaborate on operationalizing AI in mission-critical settings. Today, healthcare is radically changing with the use of large-scale ML models. Likewise, sustainability efforts are accelerating in response to the adoption of foundation models.

We invite researchers to submit 4 page extended abstracts to SMASH under one of three paper tracks: model accountability, sustainability or healthcare.

#### Why link sustainability and healthcare?
Today, healthcare presents a real-world use case for AI deployments. Production deployments raise questions about the use of large-scale computing, and, by implication, sustainability. Work in sustainability and in healthcare depend on better model accountability. Each field relies on an ecosystem of providers, tools and datasets where the risks and opportunities are borne by all.

#### Organizing Team (TBD):
- Jonathan Lebensold (Mila / Akinox)
- Scott Schaffter (Google Sustainability)
- Shahrad Mohammadzadeh (Mila / McGill)
- Doina Precup (Mila / McGill / Google Deepmind)
