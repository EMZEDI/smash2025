## Submission Details


Submissions should consist of a summary, and an extended abstract of between one and four pages (including figures and references). We invite you to use a single column LaTeX or RTF template and recommend the [ICLR 2025 OpenReview Conference Submission](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-iclr-2025-conference-submission/gqzkdyycxtvt) template.

All submissions will be evaluated in terms of relevance, impact, community interest, technical quality, and clarity. There will be no rebuttal period.  Exceptional abstracts will be selected for oral presentations and all accepted submissions will be invited to contribute a poster presentation.

Submissions are single blind, so author names should appear on submitted PDFs.
