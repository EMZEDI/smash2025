### Track 1: Model Accountability
Research into model accountability is focused on operationalizing ML in mission-critical areas, such as healthcare, transportation, logistics and pharmaceutical traceability. 

#### Some paper topics might address:
- Model performance and benchmarking methods
- Model provenance tracking (compute, datasets and foundation models)
- Model training and data privacy

### Track 2: Model Sustainability
The adoption of foundation models and AI is having a profound effect on methods for tracking environmental sustainability and CO2 emissions. 

#### Some paper topics might address:
- Improving GPU and cluster efficiency
- Metrics for CO2 emissions tracking
- Case studies for reducing CO2 emissions

### Track 3: Healthcare
AI agents are entering mission-critical settings, from patient triaging to disease prediction. The potential is immenseâ€”but so are the risks. In these high-stakes environments, mistakes can be catastrophic. AI systems depend on compute and data, increasingly fine-tuned on sensitive public and private datasets. Yet, deploying them raises serious regulatory and compliance challenges, largely due to inconsistent model metadata and deployment tools.

#### Some paper topics might address:
- Deployments of foundation models in healthcare
- Methods for responsibly leveraging patient data
- Position papers on the effect of AI on health systems
